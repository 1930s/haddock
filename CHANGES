Changes in version 0.4:

  * Import declarations which list entities in parentheses, or with
    hiding clauses, are now properly supported.  Modulo one or two
    small infelicities, the full Haskell modules system is now supported.

  * Haddock is now more flexible about the placing of separators
    (commas, semicolons) in relation to doc comments.

  * There is support for generating and reading "interface files"
    which describe the exports of a set of modules.  This is useful
    for generating documentation which hyperlinks to
    previously-generated documentation.
    
  * Support for generating the extra files required by the Microsoft
    Help compiler.

  * New option: --prologue specifies a file of documentation which is
    placed on the contents page.

  * Many bugs fixed

Changes in version 0.3:
  
  * Documentation on individual function arguments is now implemented 
  
  * Links can be made to identifiers that aren't in scope, by using
    the fully qualified name.

  * Instances are collected and listed with the appropriate classes
    and datatypes (not for derived instances yet).

  * Single quotes are only interpreted specially when they surround a
    legal Haskell identifier, otherwise they are treated literally.

  * Bird-tracked text is now literal.  If you want marked-up text in
    a code block, use the @...@ notation instead.

  * Various changes to the layout, it generally looks nicer now.

  * Various bugs fixed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
